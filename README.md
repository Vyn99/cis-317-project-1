Travis &amp; Bart's Repo

The contents of this repository are that of a single html file labeled index, styled using styles.css, and an images folder containing our website sketch, as well as the images used in the website itself.  In this project we learned how to make a sticky navbar using purely CSS, use a flexbox container to organize a website, and further usage of pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes for styling.
